# Nerd-Menu
This is my little project to give some ideas and support for some "nerd-things" that I love

Have you ever felt a little whithout creativity? Lost in a whole world of possibilities? Well, I'll try my best to help you!
I will do some generators of ideas for Magic The Gathering and RPG games, things that I love too much!

Maybe later I will do some more stuff, but now, I'm happy whith litte but useful things :)

In this moment, this program includes includes:
- A Magic The Gathering Deck Color Generator. For those like me who wants to try something new in the game but run out of ideas.
- A dice roller for Role Playing Games (RPG). It have all the dies from the d4 to d100 and a experimental option of a custom faced die.

I'm writing this program in C# while I'm learning more about the language, so, may contain some errors but, I'm doing my best :)
