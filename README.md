# Nerd-Menu
This is my little project to give some ideas and support for some "nerd-things" that I love

Have you ever felt a little whithout creativity? Lost in a whole world of possibilities? Well, I was lost too so i did this.
I made some generators for Magic The Gathering and RPG games, things that I love too much!

Maybe later I will do some more stuff, but now, I'm happy whith litte but useful things :)

In this moment, this program includes includes:
- A Magic The Gathering Deck Color Generator. For the moments I'm with no idea of what deck build.
- A dice roller for Role Playing Games (RPG). It have all the dies from the d4 to d100 and a experimental option of a custom faced die.

I'm writing this program in C# while I'm learning more about the language, so, may contain some errors but, I'm doing my best :)

## Finally
Well, I will set this project as conclude since I don't have itention to finish it. This is it, got to go :D
